# Image-Classification-SVM

Jupyter notebook that uses Support Vector Machines to classify images.

Fist, a simple multi-class classification using MNIST dataset is implemented using rbf as the kernel of the classifier.

Lastly, a dataset with the face of politicaians with a greater shape than the digits dataset (28x28) is done and a pipeline for preprocessing the data is done using PCA components (350 principal components out of 2914 flattened pixels)
